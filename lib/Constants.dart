    'tipDescriptions':
        'It all begins with soil. Achieving healthy soil starts with a soil test, and I recommend getting that test from a lab that does Albrecht method soil balancing. Unlike your local extension agent (where you can also get a test), these labs tell you which minerals your soil lacks in the root zone. It also reveals your soil’s organic matter. Apply compost and the minerals the lab suggests at the rates the test specifies for the highest yield. Also consider some amount of compost tea or extract to add the microbial life that’s needed.',

    'tipDescriptions':
        'If you plan to till, do not till when it is too wet. If the soil smears between your fingers instead of gently crumbling, that is too wet. Also consider no-till gardening. You can do this by adding thick layers of mulch to a bed and allowing several months for it to break down. If you don’t have that amount of time, try adding a thick layer of compost and planting directly into that.',

        'It is always tempting to use old seed, but unless it’s kept in ideal conditions, old seed has probably lost some of its germination rate and might not perform as well for you.',

    'tipDescriptions':
        'Wherever you are and whenever you plan to grow the crop, find varieties that match your climate or at least your heat or cold. If you live in a colder climate, look for cold-hardy varieties. In hotter climates, or for summer crops, look for those slow to bolt or ones that can handle the heat—whatever your average heat might be.',

    'tipTitle': 'Good Plant Spacing',
    'tipDescriptions':
        'If you plant too close together, you will have a lot of competition for nutrients and water. If you plant too far apart, you will have a lot of wasted space. The best way to determine the right spacing is to look at the seed packet. It will tell you how far apart to plant the seeds. If you are using transplants, you can also look at the transplant size and determine how far apart to plant them.',

    'tipDescriptions':
        'Weeds can quickly smother and outcompete crops, making them unproductive or difficult to harvest. So managing weeds becomes a critical step in having a successful crop of any sort. Not tilling helps, as does regular garden cultivation. If you address weeds from the very beginning, before there is an issue, they will always be easier to manage, which will lead to a more successful crop.',
